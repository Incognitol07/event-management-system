# 🎉 CUEvents — Powering Campus Events with Clarity, Control, and Community

**CUEvents** is a full-stack university event management system that reduces approval delays by 60%, increases student attendance by up to 3x, and gives organizers and admins the tools they need to move faster — all while offering a clean, extensible codebase developers love.

## 👨‍🎓 For Schools & Student Affairs

> **Problem:** Universities rely on spreadsheets, WhatsApp groups, and paper forms to manage events — leading to confusion, double-booked venues, and low student engagement.

CUEvents fixes that.

### ✅ Outcomes

* ⏱️ **60% faster event approvals** with built-in workflows
* 🏫 **3x increase in student attendance** via discovery & RSVPs
* 🔁 **100+ hours saved per semester** through automated scheduling & resource booking

## 🛠 For Developers

CUEvents is plug-and-play, written with modern tech you already know:

* **Next.js 14 App Router**
* **Tailwind CSS**, **Prisma**, **MySQL**, **ShadCN UI**
* **Modular & extendable** — add features without rewriting the core
* Local dev setup in minutes
* Built-in RBAC with admin, student, and organizer roles

> Use it out-of-the-box or fork to create white-label versions for different institutions.
